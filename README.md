# WorkDiCo Mask Detector Tool
One of the three tools which are part of WorkDiCo, an app service that presents a solution to optimize public places and policies for a post-COVID19 world and to deal with epidemics and disease outbreaks, in general.
This tool has been created using Keras and TensorFlow as a backend. It detects faces in a video using face-detection library and then predicts whether the person is wearing a mask or not.
The maskdetection.ipynm Jupyter notebook includes the code used to create and train the model and save it. The videomaskdetection.ipynm notebook loads the trained model, detects faces using face-detection library and uses the model to predict if the faces are wearing a mask or not.
